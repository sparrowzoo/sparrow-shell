/**
 * Under the new memory model, it is still true that volatile variables cannot be reordered with each other. The
 * difference is that it is now no longer so easy to reorder normal field accesses around them. Writing to a volatile
 * field has the same memory effect as a monitor release, and reading from a volatile field has the same memory effect
 * as a monitor acquire. In effect, because the new memory model places stricter constraints on reordering of volatile
 * field accesses with other field accesses, volatile or not, anything that was visible to thread A when it writes to
 * volatile field f becomes visible to thread B when it reads f.
